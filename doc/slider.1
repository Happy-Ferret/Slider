.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
Slider
is a pdf slideshow presentation tool that can be used on a 
single monitor, or with an optional and configurable presenter mode for 
multiple outputs (e.g. laptop screen and projector). 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-F\fP\fI config\fP
 Override the default configuration file 
.TP
\fB\-c\fP\fI class\fP
 Specify the resource class under which 
resources will be obtained from the configuration. This allows for a 
single configuration file to contain settings for different 
configurations. An example use would be a single configuration file 
which contains a default set of bindings, and bindings for a "Remote" 
class which may select key bindings to work with a presention remote. 
.TP
\fIpresentation\fP
 The primary pdf file to be used for the 
presentation (required). 
.TP
\fInotes\fP
 Secondary pdf file of presenter notes that will be 
shown on the local screen (for two outputs only). 
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION

.PP
Configuration is implemented via an X resources data base file which is 
read on startup. A well\-commented example configuration file is 
distributed with slider
and can be found at 
/usr/share/slider/config\&.
Slider checks the following paths for user configuration and uses only 
the first file found: 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/slider/config,
$HOME/.config/slider/config,
/usr/share/slider/config\&.
.PP
.SH COMMANDS

.PP
Slider is controlled by the commands described below. These commands 
can be triggered by key or button bindings as set in the configuration 
file, or the commands can be sent to the "Command" property of slider\&'s 
main window with a tool like xprop. The commands can be abbreviated to 
the first four characters (or three for dot). 
.PP
Several of these commands allow or require additional parameters which 
are provided as a white\-space delineated list. Several commands require 
a color definition which is provided as four numeric values between 0.00 
and 1.00 to define the red, green, and blue color components as well as 
an alpha (opacity) value. 
.PP
.TP
next 
Move to the next slide. 
.TP
previous 
Move to the previous slide. 
.TP
quit 
End the slide show. 
.TP
redraw 
Redraw the current slide. 
.TP
mute 
Mutes the display. And optional parameter can specify 
"black" (default) or "white" muting, or provide a full RGBA color 
specifier. (Not implemented yet). 
.TP
sorter 
Display the "slide sorter" view. 
.TP
pen 
Draw on the current slide with a selected color and line 
width. Requires five numeric parameters separated by whitespace. The 
first four define the color. The fifth parameter defines the line width. 
.TP
dot 
Set a \&'dot\&' cursor for the mouse. This can provide the same 
effect as a laser pointer, but with much better control. As \&'pen\&' this 
requires five numeric parameters. The first four define the color, the 
fifth defines a radius. 
.TP
custom 
Set a custom cursor like \&'dot\&' but rather than a circular 
dot, specify a text string to use as a cursor. This requires five 
numeric and one string parameter. The first four specify the color as 
in \&'dot\&' and \&'pen\&', the fifth specifies a font size, and the sixth 
provides the text string. 
.TP
action 
Activate action/media links. With no additional 
parameters, this command will show a standard mouse cursor and wait for 
a click event to select an action/media link. A single integer 
parameter can be provided to specify a link (the ordinal number of that 
link on the current page). A link type can also be specified to 
activate the first link of the specified type (not yet implemented). 
.TP
fullscreen 
Toggle the fullscreen state of the main presentation 
window. 
.TP
zoom 
Zoom in on a portion of the window. If numeric color 
parameters are specified, they will define how a bounding box is to be 
drawn with the mouse \- slider will then wait for a region to be selected 
with the mouse for zooming into. Zoom can also accept "quad N" 
parameters upon which it will zoom into the specified quadrant of the 
current page.
