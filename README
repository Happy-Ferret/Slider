Controls (default):
===================

Presentation mode:
	<Arrow Keys>    - move as expected to advance or go back one slide
	<Space>         - advance one slide
	Tab             - change to overview mode
	Alt+q           - exits.
	b               - black mute
	w               - white mute
	f               - toggle fullscreen
	z				- Zoom*
	#1-9			- Drawing pens
	r | <ENTER>     - redraw (unmute)
	Left mouse      - move forward one slide
	Right mouse     - move backward one slide
	Middle mouse    - change to overview mode

Overview mode: ("slide sorter")
	<Arrow Keys>    - navigate slides as expected
	Left mouse      - select a slide
	Middle mouse    - return to presentation mode
	Right mouse     - select slider and return to presentation
	r | <ENTER>     - return to presentation mode

*You can only zoom once the rendering thread is complete.  If you try to zoom
before rendering is complete you will get a 'warning' flash on the border of the
slide.  Once rendered, hit "z" then select a rectangle to zoom in on with the
mouse.

Slipper
=======

PDF presenter mode

Usage: slipper [options] <data-filename|pdf-filename>

If passed a pdf file, slipper will use default options to open a connection with an external monitor or projector, launch slider with the pdf on the external monitor, and run in presentor mode on the local screen.

For best results, however, slipper should be passed a slipper data file formatted as outlined in the example slipper.dat file that is distributed with this package.

This data file allows for customization of various options, and allows for the presentation of notes on the presenter mode (local) screen.
