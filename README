Slider has been reborn!

Slider has been entirely recoded from scratch with many design choices informed by the after-the-fact adjustments I had to make in the previous version(s).

The presenter mode tools (previous `Slipper`) have been incorporated into the main program.  Slider will now detect whether multiple screens are configured and display presenter notes on the local screen while the presentation is sent to the highest numbered monitor.

USAGE:
	slider [-sN] [-pN] [-gWxH+X+Y [-gWxH+X+Y [-gWxH+X+Y [-gWxH+X+Y]]]] <presentation.pdf> [<notes.pdf>]

	-sN		Scales the primary view in presenter mode to N times larger than secondary views (default=1.8).  This is ignored if you specify any geometry strings.  Good values for default geometries range from 1.75-3 for presentations with separate notes, or 0.5-3 for presentations alone.

	-pN		Prerenders N slides (default=1).  Rendering proceeds faster if the presentation is "prerendered", but then you have to wait for it to complete before interacting with slider.  For very large presentations, it may be useful to prerender many/all slides.  If N anything other than a positive integer, all slides are prerendered.

	-g		Geometry strings for view panes in presenter mode.  Set the width, height, and location of up to 4 panels with a notes.pdf or 3 panels without.  Panels display the following items on the local screen:

		PANEL #		DISPLAY w/Notes		DISPLAY w/o
		1			Notes slide			Current slide
		2			Current slide		Next slide
		3			Next slide			Previous slide
		4			Previous slide		N/A

		In the absense of geometry strings, what should be a useful default is selected based on whether a notes.pdf was provided.  Defaults can be adjusted with the -sN scaling factor.

	<presentation.pdf>
			Required pdf to display

	<notes.pdf>
			Optional pdf for presenter-mode notes.


---------------

Several features have been removed in the new version.  Most of these are absent only because I recoded the new version from scratch and simply have not reimplemented them yet.  Features that will definitely return include:

1) Zoom: both free zooming and locked-aspect-ratio zooming.

Features that may return in a different form:

1) Pens: I'd like to redo these using Cairo drawing functions to allow for prettier antialiased line drawing.
