Slider has been entirely recoded from scratch with many design choices informed by the after-the-fact adjustments I had to make in the previous version(s).

The presenter mode tools (previous `Slipper`) have been incorporated into the main program.  Slider will now detect whether multiple screens are configured and display presenter notes on the local screen while the presentation is sent to the highest numbered monitor.

USAGE:
	slider [-c] [-aN] [-sN] [-pN] [-m<VID1>[,<VID2>]] [-gWxH+X+Y [-gWxH+X+Y [-gWxH+X+Y [-gWxH+X+Y]]]] <presentation.pdf> [<notes.pdf>]

	-c		Continous loop mode.  When the presentation finishes, it will loop back to slide number one.

	-aN		Autoplay mode.  Slides will advance automatically at intervals of N seconds.  If N is not specified, a default of 30 is used.

	-sN		Scales the primary view in presenter mode to N times larger than secondary views (default=1.8).  This is ignored if you specify any geometry strings.  Good values for default geometries range from 1.75-3 for presentations with separate notes, or 0.5-3 for presentations alone.

	-pN		Prerenders N slides (default=1).  Rendering proceeds faster if the presentation is "prerendered", but then you have to wait for it to complete before interacting with slider.  For very large presentations, it may be useful to prerender many/all slides.  If N anything other than a positive integer, all slides are prerendered.

	-mVID1 | -mVID1,VID2
			Overrides default monitor detection and shows the presentation on output VID1.  The first form disables the presenter mode notes.  The second form sends the presentation to VID1 and the notes to VID2.

	-g		Geometry strings for view panes in presenter mode.  Set the width, height, and location of up to 4 panels with a notes.pdf or 3 panels without.  Panels display the following items on the local screen:

		PANEL #		DISPLAY w/Notes		DISPLAY w/o
		1		Notes slide		Current slide
		2		Current slide		Next slide
		3		Next slide		Previous slide
		4		Previous slide		N/A

		In the absense of geometry strings, what should be a useful default is selected based on whether a notes.pdf was provided.  Defaults can be adjusted with the -sN scaling factor.

	<presentation.pdf>
			Required pdf to display

	<notes.pdf>
			Optional pdf for presenter-mode notes.


CONTROLS:

	Key bindings can be customized by editing config.h and recompiling.  The listings below are the default settings.

	Ctrl-Q		Quit.

	Tab			Overview mode.

	Return		Refresh/Redraw.  Removes any pen/rectangle drawing, and "unzooms".

	Space		Next slide.

	Right		Next slide.

	Left		Previous slide.

	Up			Previous slide in normal mode, or up in overview mode.

	Down		Next slide in normal mode, or down in overview mode.

	b			Mute (black).

	w			Mute (white).

	z			Zoom in.

	Shift-z		Zoom in with a fixed aspect ratio.

	r			Draw a blue/cyan rectangle/box.  Colors, opacity, and line width can be customized in config.h.

	Shift-r		Draw a green rectangle/box.

	Ctrl-r		Draw a red rectanlge/box.

	1-6			Polka-dot cursors of various sizes and colors.  Colors, opacity, and size can be customized in config.h.

	F1-F6		Drawing pens of various sizes and colors.  Colors, opacity, and size can be customized in config.h.

CONFIGURATION

Slider will look in the following location for a configuration file:

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/slider/config
~/.config/slider/config
~/.sliderrc
/usr/share/slider/config

Only the first file found will be used.  /usr/share/slider/config is
installed with defaults by the Makefile install directive.
