UPDATE (4 Apr 2013): A 'new' slider is coming.

I've recoded slider completely from scratch with a cleaner design from the start.  The original slider did not do much, but as feature requests came in I tried to add them.  This became more and more impractical as slider (and slipper) ended up being held together by many layers of duct tape covered over with ugly wallpaper.

I've started completely from scratch with a better picture of the end goal contributing to basic design decisions.  The new version feels much smoother and cleaner.  Changes you can expect include the following:

1) Slipper is fully integrated - there is now only one program that will autodetect multiple monitors and accept multiple pdfs.  This provides several options for how it will run:
    - `slider my.pdf` on a single monitor set up will simply display the pdf
	- `slider my.pdf` on multimonitor will display the pdf in the highest
	        numbered monitor and a current+preview slide in the local monitor
	- `slider my.pdf notes.pdf` will display the my.pdf on the highest numbered
	        numbered monitor and present notes.pdf on the local screen along with
			a current and/or preview slide from my.pdf

2) Presenter mode is customizable:
	- pass the "-g WxH+X+Y" geometry flag from one to four times on the command line.
	- each geometry pattern will create one preview pane with the following purposes
	    1) current notes slide/page (if notes are provided)
		2) current presentation slide
        3) next presentation slide
		4) overview (slide sorter)
	- without "-g" geometries slider will default to what should be a useful setup
	    with three panel if there are notes, or two without (current, next)

3) Slider will no longer try to manage your monitors - it will only detect your settings
    - Configure your own screen setup with xrandr or xorg.conf

4) REMOVALS Slider will temporarily lack a few functions like zoom and pens.  Zoom will be easy to add back in, and the pens will be fully recoded to use cairo drawing rather than xlib - this will (should ... I think) allow for antialiased line drawing.

TIMELINE: Most of this has been coded, but I'm ironing out a couple hefty bugs before I push the code here to github.  Be warned that if you regularly update to the latest git version of slider, you will soon lose many of the options and configuration methods you are used to.  These changes should be pushed by mid April at the latest.

-------- ORIGINAL README FOR CURRENT CODE BELOW --------



Slider
======

PDF presentation program

Partially inspired by Impressive but coded entirely separately from scratch in pure C.

Dependencies: poppler-glib

Usage: slider [options] <pdf-filename>
  options: -f  to *not* start in fullscreen mode.

See discussion here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=147952

Controls (default):
===================

Presentation mode:
	<Arrow Keys>    - move as expected to advance or go back one slide
	<Space>         - advance one slide
	Tab             - change to overview mode
	Alt+q           - exits.
	b               - black mute
	w               - white mute
	f               - toggle fullscreen
	z				- Zoom*
	#1-9			- Drawing pens
	r | <ENTER>     - redraw (unmute)
	Left mouse      - move forward one slide
	Right mouse     - move backward one slide
	Middle mouse    - change to overview mode

Overview mode: ("slide sorter")
	<Arrow Keys>    - navigate slides as expected
	Left mouse      - select a slide
	Middle mouse    - return to presentation mode
	Right mouse     - select slider and return to presentation
	r | <ENTER>     - return to presentation mode

*You can only zoom once the rendering thread is complete.  If you try to zoom
before rendering is complete you will get a 'warning' flash on the border of the
slide.  Once rendered, hit "z" then select a rectangle to zoom in on with the
mouse.

Slipper
=======

PDF presenter mode

Usage: slipper [options] <data-filename|pdf-filename>

If passed a pdf file, slipper will use default options to open a connection with an external monitor or projector, launch slider with the pdf on the external monitor, and run in presentor mode on the local screen.

For best results, however, slipper should be passed a slipper data file formatted as outlined in the example slipper.dat file that is distributed with this package.

This data file allows for customization of various options, and allows for the presentation of notes on the presenter mode (local) screen.
